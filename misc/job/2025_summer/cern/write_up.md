- Researching hypertoric varieties in algebraic geometry. Exploring its F_q polynomial and associated h-polynomial complex. The theoretical problem was broken down into a more straightforward combinatorial approach by counting the points of intersection in simple hyperplane arrangement in F_p^n.
- Testing and developing drivers for Dolphin Interconnect PCIe NTB.  NTB can expose the memory of guest machine into the host machine. I was trying to find a way to make this memory cacheable.

# Message to Hiring Team 

I was born in China, attended high school in the US, and I am currently an undergraduate student in the University of Edinburgh studying mathematics, passionate in pure math and mathematical physics, and aspiring to become a mathematics researcher in the future. 
I have taken and performed well on modules including differential geometry, topology, and Lie group, conducted research on algebraic geometry and Linux Kernel CXL in the University of Edinburgh, and self-studied extensively in physics and computer science. 
I believe the summer program at CERN will be a valuable opportunity for me to learn about how cutting-edge research is done and study advanced math and physics with like-minded fellow students under expert scientists.
As I aspire to become a researcher, this will be extremely beneficiary to my career development.
In the meantime, I hope my expertise in pure mathematics and computer science can contribute to the community at CERN.

## Motivation 

I am interested in mathematics and mathematical physics, and I would like to become a research in related field in the future. 
Summer student programme at CERN will be an exceptional opportunity for me to know more about how cutting-edge research was conducted and will be extremely beneficiary to my future career development. 
Another motivation of mine is to learn more advance math and physics at CERN with like-minded fellow students under expert scientists.
