# Warwick Mathematics CDT 

Requires two documents: research proposal and personal statement. 

## Personal Statement 

The requirement is 

> Please draft a brief (4,500 characters maximum) personal statement that:
>
>    Explains your interest in this specific course
>    Describes how this course will help you to achieve any future study plans
>    Describes how this course will help you to achieve any future career plans
>    Advice and guidance on personal statements. Guide to writing your personal statement (warwick.ac.uk)

## Research Proposal 

> Specific research projects are not required, and many applicants will have broad interests and not have settled on very specific areas or projects. In that case it is a good idea to use the research proposal document to describe the main areas of interests, what you have learned and find exciting about them, and any projects/thesis that you have done during your degree.
> Of course, if you have a clear research interest or a specific project you want to work, please submit it as your research proposal.
