    abstract = { Abstract We study the problem of constructing worst-case algorithms from average-case algorithms. Prior to this work, such reductions were only known for a small number of specific problems or restricted computational models. In contrast, we show that for quantum computation, all linear problems admit worst-case to average-case reductions. Specifically, we provide an explicit and efficient transformation of quantum algorithms that are only correct on a small (even sub-constant) fraction of their inputs into ones that are correct on all inputs. En route, we obtain a tight Ω(n2) lower bound on the average-case quantum query complexity of the Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem. Our techniques strengthen and generalise the recently introduced additive combinatorics framework for classical worst-case to average-case reductions (STOC 2022). We rely on quantum singular value transformations to construct quantum algorithms for linear verification in superposition and learning Bogolyubov subspaces from noisy quantum oracles, which could be of independent interest. We use these tools to prove a quantum local correction lemma, which lies at the heart of our reductions, based on a noise- robust probabilistic generalisation of Bogolyubov's lemma from additive combinatorics. }
