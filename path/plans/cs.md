## Learning

### Linux Kernel

- (Aug 9, 2023) Learn Linux kernel: send some patches; probably beginning in the driver's sector. See the book linux device drivers
    - Linux bug report, see [website](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?chfield=%5BBug%20creation%5D&chfieldfrom=24h)

### Computer Graphics

### Function Programming: Types 

- (Aug 9 2023) Haskell and Agda

## Short Term Ambition

### Latin Parser

The only available latin parser online is whitaker's words. Which, I think is obselete.

Create a latin parser that parse the latin words to its stem, declension, congugation, etc. 

Also, it shall be able to scan hexameters.

## Long Term Ambition

### Project: Latex Substitute

We love latex, because it is the most, if not the only one, competent tool that empower us to typset professional level documents with our PC. We hate latex, because it contain so much of obscurity that have caused us endless trouble during typsetting. 

So I want to create a latex substitute. 

Computer typsetting seems to be a field that is neglected by most: hackers, programmers, and others with ability to create such a system are occupied by more lofty subjects such as the kernel, AIs, and the web. Those most in need of such a new system, who delve hours of their time struggling with tex, are mathematicians, physicists, chemists, even classists, who do not even dream of such an enterprise. Indeed the creator of tex was the combination of both: Donald Knuth is one of the best mathematician and programmer of our time. 

#### Other simialr project

- typst: written in rust. Markdown style format, still in early development stage and seems to lose its activity.
- Luatex, Xetex, etc: improvement on tex engine

#### Goal

A tool to help ordinary people to typset professional level documents with ease. So far, I think this tool shall be in the form of a mark down style computer language.

#### To accomplish the project

- Learn what makes a good computer language
- Learn typsetting, formmating, and art.
- Learn make up of pdf.

#### Resource

- Digital Typography, Donald E. Knuth. Book
- Poppler, a C++ pdf library
- xpdf, an open source pdf viewer and toolkit
- ghostscript

## Quick Ideas

- Benchmarking L1, L2, L3 cache lantency and intercore latency
- autopull: pull git repo automatically
