### Math library

Math library for efficient and accurate computation.

### 3D physics engine for research

A physical engine with good graphics, that is factually accurate, implementing efficient mathamtics algorithms, easy to use, and can be played as a game or used to conduct research.

It can be used to simulate the solar system, pendulums, fluid dynamics, etc. 

### Mathematics Graphics engine

There are still limited graphing software for math, including free software like desmos or proprietary software like Mathematica. Their graphing capabilities, especially for compilcated graphs with implicit functions, non algebraic functions, or multidimension graphs, are greatly limited.

I want to create a capable graphing software that is free, easy to use, and produce beautiful and accurate results.
