Question to ask the supervisor:

1. What do you expect from me? What is your expectation for your PhD students?
1. How many months a year am I expected to work? As a Chinese student, can I travel back home around Chinese New Year?

## How to reach out to supervisors. 

> People make decision based on emotions, and try to justify them using facts.

1. Show interest to the supervisors work. (If you are not interested, you probably should not apply.)
1. Present CV, skills in the end. Do not brag but admit shortcomings.
