It takes little effort to create an blogging website with Hugo, Papermod, and Github pages. (Maintaining and writing, of course, is a completely different buesiness). 

To create a website requires two steps
1. create html, css, javascript files;
1. host this files on a server that is accessible to the internet.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.com) and Papermod can create the neccessary files with ease. 
Github pages is the serive that hosts the file link a domain name to them.
